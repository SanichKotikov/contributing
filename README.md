# Contributing

A few tips before suggesting your changes:

- It's typically a good idea to submit a proposal for a change before spending time implementing it. This is to ensure that your efforts align with the current needs or more practically that work isn't completed by multiple contributors.

- Please keep the code style if the project does not have any formatting tools. This also applies to discussions like "function vs arrow function", "const vs let vs var", etc.

- It's a good idea to create one PR for one thing. If you include a lot of unrelated changes, you may end up with one thing blocking the others.
